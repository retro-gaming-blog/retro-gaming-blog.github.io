                        <h1>Unlocking the Nostalgia: Top 10 Retro Gaming Handhelds You Must Try in 2023</h1>
<p>Ah, nostalgia. That warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you think back to the "good old days". And nothing screams nostalgia quite like retro gaming handhelds. Remember those times when blowing into a cartridge was a legit troubleshooting technique? Or when saving your game meant hoping your mom wouldn’t turn off the console? Ah, those were the days. But fear not, dear reader, for the past is not lost, it is merely tucked away in the form of gaming handhelds! So, let's dust off those memories and dive into the top 10 retro gaming handhelds you must try in 2023.</p>
<h2>1. Game Boy Advance SP</h2>
<p>First on the list has to be the Game Boy Advance SP. This little gem is the Swiss Army knife of retro handhelds. It has a clamshell design, which back in the day was as futuristic as flying cars. And it's backlit! Meaning you no longer have to play under a lamp or use the streetlights while on a car trip. Don’t you miss the simpler times?</p>
<h2>2. Sega Game Gear</h2>
<p>Now, for something colorful. The Sega Game Gear. This beast was color gaming in the palm of your hand before it was cool. Sure, it ate batteries like I devour pizza on a Saturday night, but who cares? It had a color screen!</p>
<h2>3. Nintendo DS</h2>
<p>Remember stylus gaming? No, not on your smartphone. The Nintendo DS, the godfather of stylus gaming, deserves a spot on this list. It was the first to bring touch screen gaming to the masses and it did it with style. The DS stands for "dual screen" but I always thought it should stand for "darn swell" because that's what this console is.</p>
<h2>4. Neo Geo Pocket Color</h2>
<p>SNK's Neo Geo Pocket Color is like that indie band that you discovered before they became mainstream. It's a hipster's dream with a strong line-up of fighting games. Plus, it has a clicky joystick. A clicky joystick!</p>
<h2>5. PlayStation Portable (PSP)</h2>
<p>Sony's PlayStation Portable, or as I like to call it, the "Portable Powerhouse". This bad boy played games, movies, music, and even browsed the internet. Basically, it was a smartphone before smartphones were a thing. And it played God of War, so, enough said.</p>
<h2>6. Atari Lynx</h2>
<p>Ever heard of the Atari Lynx? No? Well, it was the first handheld with a color screen. Yes, it was a battery guzzler, but it was also the first handheld that allowed you to flip the system for left-handed users. Equal rights for left-handers, finally!</p>
<h2>7. Nintendo Game Boy</h2>
<p>This list wouldn't be complete without the OG of handhelds - the Nintendo Game Boy. It was as simple as gaming could get. A green screen, two buttons, and a D-pad. It didn't need color because it had something far more important - Tetris.</p>
<h2>8. Nintendo Switch Lite</h2>
<p>I know what you're thinking - "The Switch Lite isn't retro!" Well, hear me out. It has a built-in D-pad, no detachable joy-cons, and it's purely handheld. Plus, it plays all the classic Nintendo games. Sounds pretty retro to me.</p>
<h2>9. TurboExpress</h2>
<p>The TurboExpress was essentially a portable TurboGrafx-16, which is as cool as it sounds. It played all the same HuCard games as its big brother. It was like carrying a home console in your pocket. Who wouldn't want that?</p>
<h2>10. WonderSwan Color</h2>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, is the WonderSwan Color. This Japan-only console was as quirky as they come. It had a vertical and horizontal mode, which was pretty innovative at the time. Plus, it was the only handheld to have a Final Fantasy game made specifically for it. </p>
<p>So, there you have it - the top 10 retro gaming handhelds you must try in 2023. Whether you're a hardcore gamer or just someone looking for a hit of nostalgia, these consoles are sure to transport you back to a simpler time. A time when gaming was about fun, not frame rates. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some high scores to beat.</p>
