                        <h1>Top 10 Retro Gaming Handhelds: A Comprehensive Guide to Nostalgic Gaming in 2023</h1>
<p>We all love a good blast from the past. The flicker of the old CRT TV, the squishy keys of a ZX Spectrum... It's all too tempting. But what if we could step back into those golden years of gaming, without having to dredge up a two-tonne 'portable' computer from your grandparent's basement? Thankfully, the miracle of retro gaming handhelds lets us do just that. Buckle up, dear readers, because we're about to embark on a journey through the top 10 retro gaming handhelds in 2023. </p>
<h2>1. Game Boy Advance SP</h2>
<p>Now if this doesn't trigger a bout of nostalgia, I don't know what will. The Game Boy Advance SP, ever the crowd-pleaser, is a handheld console that folds up small enough to fit in your pocket comfortably. It's like a clamshell phone, but instead of your boss calling you on a Sunday morning, it's a Pokemon battle.</p>
<p>C'mon, who didn't enjoy the annoying 'low battery' beep while on the final level of Super Mario Bros 3? And let's not forget the magic of an unlit screen in the dark, making gaming a fun game of guess where Bowser is.</p>
<h2>2. Sega Game Gear</h2>
<p>Ah, the Sega Game Gear, the only handheld system to give the Game Boy a run for its money back in the day. It was as colourful as a rainbow and as power-hungry as a moody teenager. </p>
<p>Remember those 6 AA batteries it needed? Yes, SIX! You almost needed a second paper round just to keep Sonic running. But the backlit screen and a TV tuner add-on? It definitely had its charm, didn't it?</p>
<h2>3. Nintendo Game Boy</h2>
<p>Ah, the old grey brick. So many memories, so many hours spent squinting at a tiny green and black screen. You could probably build a house with all the sturdy Nintendo Game Boys out there.</p>
<p>Who could forget the nail-biting Tetris games, or stumbling around in Pokemon Blue because you were too stubborn to buy a flashlight in Vermilion City?</p>
<h2>4. Atari Lynx</h2>
<p>This one's a bit controversial. The Atari Lynx: a console too powerful for its own good. This baby could do things no other handheld could dream of. </p>
<p>Remember flipping the console over for left-handed controls? Only to find out that none of the buttons were in the right place. Or the sheer horror of realising it's eaten up all your batteries, just as you were about to defeat Dracula in 'Dracula the Undead'?</p>
<h2>5. PlayStation Portable (PSP)</h2>
<p>Sony's PlayStation Portable was what every teenager wanted back in 2004. It was cool, sleek, and you could even watch movies on it. It was the true all-rounder. </p>
<p>But, let's be honest, who actually watched movies on their PSP? Wasn't it more fun to pretend you were playing Grand Theft Auto while secretly watching the bonus features of Spiderman 2?</p>
<h2>6. Nintendo DS</h2>
<p>The Nintendo DS: a revolution in twiddly-screen gaming, right? If you've never played Brain Age while having a coffee, have you really lived?</p>
<p>And let's not forget the wonderful experience of trying to keep hold of those tiny stylus pens. Like trying to herd a group of very small, slippery eels, right? </p>
<h2>7. Neo Geo Pocket Color</h2>
<p>The Neo Geo Pocket Color was a bit of an underdog in the world of handhelds. It had 16-bit graphics, a slick design... and a library of games you could count on one hand. </p>
<p>Remember feeling excited to find a game that wasn't a fighting game? Yeah, those were the days.</p>
<h2>8. PlayStation Vita</h2>
<p>The PlayStation Vita, a handheld that was ahead of its time. It had an OLED screen before they were cool and more power than an energy drink. </p>
<p>But, let's face it, how many of us used it to play PS4 games in the bathroom? </p>
<h2>9. TurboExpress</h2>
<p>The TurboExpress: a handheld so rare that spotting one in the wild was like seeing a unicorn. If only it didn't devour batteries quicker than a mechanical Godzilla.</p>
<p>Who else remembers the joy of squinting at the tiniest screen imaginable, trying to make out the details of Bonk's Adventure?</p>
<h2>10. Nintendo Switch Lite</h2>
<p>And here we are, at the end of our nostalgic journey. The Nintendo Switch Lite, the modern gamer's Game Boy. It's handheld, lightweight, and you can even play Breath of the Wild on it.</p>
<p>But, remember when we all thought we'd use the Joy-Con controllers detached? Good times, good times.</p>
<p>Remember folks, when it comes to retro gaming, it's not about the pixels on the screen or the battery life. It's about recapturing those moments of our youth, that feeling of finding a secret level, or finally conquering that boss battle. So here's to more years of nostalgic gaming, may our thumbs never tire and our batteries never run out.</p>
